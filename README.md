# Node-Internationalization-Using-HashMap

So, my last repository used IBM Internationalization module and I thought how could we create our own internationalization module.
Then I read Alex Nadalin article on a creation of perfect Hash Map table with the minimal collison effect. 
I used that HashMap table to map words from English to French.

The work is still under progress but open for contributions.

So, here we start first we create the hashMap table using the Node Module 'string-hash'. And export the whole hashMap module and
then using the set function map the words from English to French.

To use the application just run => node app.js in the terminal and voila see the magic.
